5. _Deep Learning_ by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. Free online version [here](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/).
6. _Introduction to Information Retrieval_ by Christopher D. Manning, Prabhakar Raghavan, and Hinrich Sch√ºtze. Essential for anyone interested in Natural Language Processing. Free online version [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/information-retrieval-book.html).
7. _Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction_ by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto. Essential for reinforcement learning. Free online version [here](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html).
8. [OpenAI Spinning up in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/): A collection of articles that give great intuition for many RL algorithms. Highly recommended for anyone interested in RL.
9. _Convex Optimization_ by Stephen Boyd and Lieven Vandenberghe. Super helpful but also super hard -- Stephen Boyd is basically a god. Free online version [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/bv_cvxbook.pdf).
10. _Mining of Massive Datasets_ by Jure Leskovec, Anand Rajaraman, and Jeff Ullman. This book is extremely relevant as machine learning is moving towards bigger models that use massive amounts of compute and data. Free online version [here](http://www.mmds.org/).
11. Deep Learning with Hadoop & Apache Spark

    No book on the subject that I can find, but there are a few helpful articles [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-learning-with-apache-spark-part-1-6d397c16abd).
