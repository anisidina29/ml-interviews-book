### 2.1.1 What companies want from candidates

The goal of the interviewing process is for a company to assess:



1. whether you have the necessary skills and knowledge to do the job
2. whether they can provide you with a suitable environment to carry out that task.

Companies will be looking at both your technical and non-technical skills.
