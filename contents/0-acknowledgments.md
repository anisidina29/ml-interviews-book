### Acknowledgments

This work wouldn’t be possible without the generous help of many friends and colleagues, listed in no particular order. If I’ve forgotten to include your name, it’s not because your contribution didn’t matter, but because my memory is faulty. If that’s the case, please let me know and I’ll try to rectify that!

All the glory belongs to those who made it better. All the mistakes belong to me.

Ben Krause (a hero I don’t deserve), Joshua Levy (whose invaluable insights helped me restructure the entire first part), Luke Metz (my ever-forbearing first reader), Boris Ginsburg, Oleksii Kuchaiev, Raine Hoover, Akshay Agrawal, Hugo Valdivia, Dat Tran, Nick Pawlowski, David Bourgin, Kyle Kranen, Mike Houston, Yang Zhang, Adeh DeSandies, Marko Vasic, Karson Elmgren, Andrej Karpathy.
