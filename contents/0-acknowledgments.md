### Acknowledgments

This work wouldn’t be possible without the generous help of many friends and colleagues, listed in no particular order. If I’ve forgotten to include your name, it’s not because your contribution didn’t matter, but because my memory is faulty. If that’s the case, please let me know and I’ll try to rectify that!

All the glory belongs to those who made it better. All the mistakes belong to me.
