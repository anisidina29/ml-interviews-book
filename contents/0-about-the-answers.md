### About the answers

I started the book with the naive optimism that I’d write the answers for every question in this book. It turned out writing detailed answers to 300+ technical questions -- while juggling a full-time job, a teaching gig, a raging pandemic with a couple of family members in the hospital -- is a lot.

Given the slow progress I’ve been making, I’ve decided that publishing the draft then continuing writing/crowdsourcing the answers might be more productive. The first draft of the book has the answers for about 10% of all the questions. These existing answers, while I believe to be sufficiently mathematically rigorous, prioritize intuitive explanations over mathematical equations. The answers for the questions will be continually updated. Answer contribution via [the book’s GitHub repository](https://github.com/chiphuyen) is much appreciated.

Hiring is a process, and questions aren’t evaluated in isolation. Your answer to each question is evaluated as part of your performance during the entire process. A candidate who claims to work with computer vision and fails to answer a question about techniques typically used for computer vision tasks is going to be evaluated differently from a candidate who doesn’t work with computer vision at all. Interviewers often care more about your approach than the actual objective correctness of your answers.
