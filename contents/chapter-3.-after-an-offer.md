# Chapter 3. After an offer

Life doesn’t end after a rejection. It doesn’t end after getting an offer either. You might want to negotiate your offer, consider other opportunities, contemplate your career perspective at the company or after you leave.

It seems silly to think about leaving a company before joining, but at 13.2%, the tech industry has the highest turnover rate out of all business sections. Median tenure at Amazon is one year, and Google 1.1 years[^50]. You might find yourself being a candidate again sooner than you would think.

In this chapter, we’ll discuss compensation details and career progression that might be useful when you consider your options.
